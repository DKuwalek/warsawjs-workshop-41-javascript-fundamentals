## Variables training
1. Define two variables containing your name and surname
Display these variables in console, then let console greet you
Example: For variables `'Krzysztof'`, `'Wokay'` console should write `'Hey Krzysztof Wokay, it's nice to see you'`
2. Create variable which contains your Age, Later create variable named: `myAgeIn10Years` which will contain your age in next 10 years
3. Execute code belowe
```
    let tellMeSth = "Who are you?";
    let whoIAm = prompt(tellMeSth);
    
    //What is WhoIAm??
```
Check what data is hidden under variable `whoIAm`
4. Using knowledge from second and third practice, create small algorithm which will count user's birthday date, basing on his age.

Tips: Firstly ask user about age, third task can be usefull. What is type of given variable's value?
